enters the correct number the program writes a winning message and exits. If the user fails to enter the
correct number in three guesses, the program writes a failure message and exits. The program also
writes "cold" when the guess is 3 or more away from the correct answer, "warm" when the guess is 2
away, and "hot" when the guess is 1 away
